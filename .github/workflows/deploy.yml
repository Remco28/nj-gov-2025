# Deploy VitePress to GitHub Pages
#
# This workflow automatically builds and deploys the VitePress documentation site
# to GitHub Pages whenever changes are pushed to the main branch.
#
# MANUAL SETUP REQUIRED:
# Before this workflow can succeed, configure your GitHub repository:
# 1. Go to Settings > Pages
# 2. Under "Build and deployment", set Source to "GitHub Actions"
# 3. Go to Settings > Actions > General
# 4. Under "Workflow permissions", ensure "Read and write permissions" is enabled
#    (or at minimum, ensure Actions can create Pages deployments)
#
# No secrets are required - the workflow uses the default GITHUB_TOKEN.
