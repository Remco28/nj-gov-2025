[2025-10-22T20:30Z] [CLAUDE]: IMPL IN_PROGRESS: Implementing GitHub Actions workflow for VitePress deployment to GitHub Pages
[2025-10-22T20:35Z] [CLAUDE]: IMPL DONE: Created .github/workflows/deploy.yml with complete GitHub Actions workflow for automated VitePress deployment to GitHub Pages. Includes documentation for required manual GitHub repository settings.
[2025-10-22T20:55Z] [ARCHITECT]: SPEC READY 2025-10-22-phase-2-modular-content
[2025-10-22T21:00Z] [CLAUDE]: IMPL IN_PROGRESS: Implementing Phase 2 modular content structure with data-driven candidate components
[2025-10-22T21:15Z] [CLAUDE]: IMPL DONE: Completed Phase 2 modular content structure. Created data layer (candidates.json, candidates.ts), Vue components (CandidateCard, CandidateGrid), updated pages to use data-driven components, documented architecture. Build verified successful.
[2025-10-22T21:38Z] [ARCHITECT]: SPEC READY 2025-10-22-phase-3-interactive-components
[2025-10-22T21:40Z] [CLAUDE]: IMPL IN_PROGRESS: Implementing Phase 3 interactive components (spinner, speech bubble, modal) with accessibility support
[2025-10-22T22:05Z] [CLAUDE]: IMPL DONE: Completed Phase 3 interactive experience. Created talking points data structure, state management composable, four interactive Vue components (SpinnerButton, TalkingPointBubble, TalkingPointModal, CandidateInteractive), integrated into candidates page, full accessibility support (keyboard nav, focus trapping, ARIA), documented architecture and content management. Build verified successful.
[2025-10-23T20:16Z] [ARCHITECT]: SPEC READY 2025-10-23-qa-dashboards
[2025-10-23T20:20Z] [CLAUDE]: IMPL IN_PROGRESS: Implementing QA Dashboards for content coverage with metrics, candidate stats, and data quality issue detection
[2025-10-23T20:45Z] [CLAUDE]: IMPL DONE: Completed QA Dashboard implementation. Created qaMetrics.ts data module with typed helpers, three Vue components (QaMetricCard, QaMetricGrid, QaIssueList), QA dashboard page at /qa/, updated navigation and theme, documented in ARCHITECTURE.md and content/README.md. Build verified successful.
[2025-10-23T21:00Z] [CLAUDE]: FIX: Corrected import paths in QaMetricGrid.vue and QaIssueList.vue from ../../data/qaMetrics to ../../../data/qaMetrics. Build re-verified successful.

[2025-10-24T15:00Z] [ARCHITECT]: SPEC READY 2025-10-24-phase-4-all-points-overview
[2025-10-30T12:00Z] [CLAUDE]: IMPL IN_PROGRESS: Implementing Phase 4 All-Points Overview page with data aggregation helpers, modal context enhancements, and deep-link support
[2025-10-30T13:30Z] [CLAUDE]: IMPL DONE: Completed Phase 4 All-Points Overview. Created data aggregation helpers (CandidateTalkingPointEntry interface, getAllCandidateTalkingPoints, findCandidateTalkingPoint) in candidates.ts. Enhanced TalkingPointModal with optional contextLabel prop. Updated CandidateInteractive to pass candidate context to modal. Created /all-points/ page with full candidate/talking point index, quick navigation, deep-link support via hash fragments, and modal integration. Updated navigation config, added callout in /candidates/, documented in ARCHITECTURE.md, updated NEXT_STEPS.md. Build verified successful.
[2025-10-30T13:45Z] [CLAUDE]: NOTE: Encountered VitePress SSR rendering issues during implementation. Vue v-for with inline filters or direct array access caused "Cannot read properties of undefined" errors during build, even with valid source data. Resolution: Use computed properties with explicit loop-based validation instead of inline filters or optional chaining in templates. Documented SSR best practices in ARCHITECTURE.md for future reference.
[2025-10-30T14:00Z] [CLAUDE]: FIX: Applied architect feedback. (1) Replaced manual hash-parsing loop in deep-link handler with centralized findCandidateTalkingPoint helper to ensure ID normalization stays aligned with data layer. (2) Fixed focus restoration for deep-linked modals: now captures the card's button element and restores focus to it on close, preventing focus from dropping to page top. Button click handlers now pass event.currentTarget to openModalForTalkingPoint. Build re-verified successful.
[2025-10-30T14:30Z] [ARCHITECT]: REVIEW PASS 2025-10-24-phase-4-all-points-overview
[2025-10-30T15:00Z] [CLAUDE]: UI IMPROVEMENT: Replaced dice icon in SpinnerButton with candidate headshot images. Updated SpinnerButton to accept headshot and candidateName props. Modified CandidateInteractive to pass candidate photo to spinner. Combined "Interactive Explorer" and "All Candidates" sections on /candidates/ page into single unified view. Removed redundant CandidateGrid component usage. Build verified successful.
[2025-10-30T15:15Z] [CLAUDE]: UI REFINEMENT: Constrained SpinnerButton size to fixed dimensions (140px desktop, 110px mobile) for better visual balance. Changed from flexible min-width/height to fixed width/height, removed internal padding, increased border width to 3px, added overflow:hidden for clean circular crop. Build verified successful.
